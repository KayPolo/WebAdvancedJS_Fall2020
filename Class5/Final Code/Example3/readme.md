npm install -g nodemon --save-dev //This is not a necesary application, it is more for convinience
                               //nodemon looks for changes in your code and automatically resets the ///browser, so you don't need to do it manually. 
                               // The reason why we save this into --save-dev is because this is not a necesary dependancy, it's more for convinience.
